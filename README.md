# MyWallet

Frontend web and mobile application developed in ReactJS using Create-React-App for the daily management and control of your finances.

Try it out now on the application deploy: https://projeto14-mywallet-front-umber.vercel.app/ <br/> <br/>

## About

- [x] I used ContextAPI resources for managing global states, such as the logged-in user and history of income and expenditure in financial transactions, to avoid state handling issues.
- [x] The Registration screen (`/cadastro`) is implemented.
- [x] The Login screen (`/`) is implemented.
- [x] User information is displayed at the top.
- [x] Users can add income or expense transactions in the application on the route screen (`/nova-transacao/:tipo`)
- [x] On the (`/home`) screen, the user is able to view all their transactions made up to that point.
- [x] By clicking the `logout` button, the user is logged out and then redirected to the (`login`) screen..
